# Password-Generator
This repository is an exhibition of a generic password creator. The generator prompts the user to configure a set of requirements before receiving a strong password. A minimum length is required alongside one of four other critical requirements such as the presence of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

## Why do strong passwords matter?
Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information. The stronger your password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and malicious software.

## How did I refactor the codebase for this particular assignment?
With dynamically updated HTML and CSS provided, I simply used JavaScript logic to enable the interface in generating a secure password for the user.
